==How to use this protocol==

Includes:
{{{
#include "protocol.h"
#include "message_handler.h"
}}}

Buffers:

message_buffer_t* buffers = protocol_allocate;

just push new message to tx buffer

{{{protocol_push( buffers->tx , message_t** )}}}

or read message from bytestream:
{{{protocol_push( buffers->rx, protocol_parse_raw_message(U8 **stream, int len) );}}}

also need to handle messages
{{{handle_message( protocol_pop_botton( buffers->rx) );}}}

and delete handled rx message from buffer:
{{{protocol_pop_delete( buffers->rx);}}}

Just so simple as can.. or is it? if You think it can be more simple, explain what you are thinking to me and maybe I learn more.... =)
