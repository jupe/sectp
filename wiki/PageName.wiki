*How to use this protocol*

_just push new message to tx buffer:_

protocol_push( LinkedList_t\* txbuffer ,message_t\* )

_or read message from bytestream:_
protocol_push( LinkedList_t* rxbuffer, protocol_parse_raw_message(U8 \*stream, int len) );

_also need to handle messages:_
handle_message( protocol_pop_botton( rxbuffer) );

_and delete handled rx message from buffer
protocol_pop_delete( rxbuffer );
